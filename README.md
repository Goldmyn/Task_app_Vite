# TASK APP

This is a simple Todo List application built with React, Ant Design, and Tailwind CSS showcasing modern React principles and ES6 syntax.

## Features

- Add new tasks with name and description.
- Edit tasks and toggle their completion status.
- Delete tasks with a simple button click.
- Persists data in local storage for session continuity.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Notes

1. **State Management:** The application uses React's built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage state and perform side effects.
2. **Local Storage:** Task data is persisted to local storage, ensuring tasks are retained across sessions.
3. **Ant Design**: The UI is enhanced with Ant Design components, while Tailwind CSS is used for small custom styles.
4. **Functional components**: All components are functional and take advantage of modern JavaScript, including destructuring and arrow functions.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this implementation to suit your needs!
